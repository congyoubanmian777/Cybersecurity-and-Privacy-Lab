There are two main experimental platform we use one is CARLA 0.9.9, another is HFO.
CARLA: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla
HFO: https://github.com/LARG/HFO

1. CARLA_RL.py is the code of deep reinforcement learning method on CARLA.
2. CARLA_advice_reuse.py is the code of advice reuse method on CARLA.
3. CARLA_model_based.py is the code of our proposed method on CARLA.
4. student.txt and teacher.txt are used to store data created by the vehicles from Carla.
5. HFO_RL.py is the code of reinforcement learning method on HFO.
6. HFO_RL.sh is the running file of reinforcement learning method on HFO.
7. HFO_advice_reuse.py is the code of advice reuse method on HFO.
8. HFO_advice_reuse.sh is the running file of advice reuse method on HFO.
9. HFO_model_based.py  is the code of our proposed method on HFO.
10. HFO_model_based.sh  the running file our proposed method on HFO.
11.ROBOT_RL.py is the code of deep reinforcement learning method on sweeping robot.
12.ROBOT_advice_reuse.py is the code of advice reuse method on sweeping robot.
13.ROBOT_model_based.py is the code of our proposed method on sweeping robot.

In CARLA, the complexity of the environment can be adjusted by changing the number of vehicles.
In sweeping robot, the complexity of the environment can be adjusted by changing the size of the map, the number of obstacles and target points.
